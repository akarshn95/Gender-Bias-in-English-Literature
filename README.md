# Gender-Bias-in-English-Literature

Our main experimental objective in compiling this data was to extract and count all unique characters from a given corpus of modern English literary texts. A secondary aim was to detect the ‘gender’ of these characters, and count the numbers of times that they were mentioned in the book, as well as the counts of gender-specific pronouns in the books. Finally, we aimed to automatically detect the gender of the author of each book using a combination of semi-automatic heuristic techniques, including manual lookup using internet resources such as Wikipedia.

To replicate each of the hypothesis and their statistical significance, clone the repository and run the .py files corresponding to each of the hypothesis.
